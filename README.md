# Hand-Tracking System Using AIML

An **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)** project that uses real-time hand tracking to enable gesture recognition. This system detects hand movements and recognizes gestures to control virtual drawing tools, such as an airbrush, in a video feed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Detects and tracks hand landmarks using a webcam.
- **Gesture-Based Control**: Supports gestures to draw, erase, and change brush size or color.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Displays the video feed with overlaid hand tracking and virtual drawings.
- **Customization**: Easy to configure gesture mappings and brush settings.
