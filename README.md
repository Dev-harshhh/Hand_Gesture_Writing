# Hand-Tracking System Using AIML

An **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)** project that uses real-time hand tracking to enable gesture recognition. This system detects hand movements and recognizes gestures to control virtual drawing tools, such as an airbrush, in a video feed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Detects and tracks hand landmarks using a webcam.
- **Gesture-Based Control**: Supports gestures to draw, erase, and change brush size or color.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Displays the video feed with overlaid hand tracking and virtual drawings.
- **Customization**: Easy to configure gesture mappings and brush settings.

## Installation

Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

- **pip install -r requirements.txt**
- Verify Installation
- Ensure that your webcam is accessible and working with OpenCV.

## Controls
- Draw: Move your first two fingers in the air to draw.
- Erase: Move your first four fingers to erase.

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following software is installed on your system:
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- A webcam or laptop camera.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV for video processing
- MediaPipe for hand landmark detection
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for visualizations (if needed)
- AIML Algorithms for gesture recognition and system intelligence

## Future Scope
- Enhanced Gesture Recognition: Incorporate more gestures for complex controls.
- Multi-Hand Support: Enable tracking and interaction for both hands.
- Application Integration: Use hand gestures to control external applications or games.
- Web Deployment: Deploy the system in a web application.
